/**
Lab: Instantiable Classes
Problem 2
Route 66 is a highway in the USA with a length of 3,945 Km.
A cross country Bicycle race has been scheduled where people work in teams to cycle this highway non-stop
from one end to the other.
The race has a rule that no one cyclist can cycle for more than 15 hours at a time.
You have been asked to develop an application that allows the user to enter
the team's projected average speed in kilometres per hour and the number of members on the team.
The application should then calculate and display:
-- the time it will take the team to complete the journey,
-- the number of full 15 hour blocks to be cycled,
-- how many full blocks each team member will cycle,
-- how many hours would be leftover at the end.
Your application should be developed using instantiable classes.
All classes should be correctly commented and formatted.
Save your instantiable class as Route66.java
Route66.java -- the instantiable class which calculates the different metrics according to the problem description
